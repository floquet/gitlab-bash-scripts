Out of Memory (OOM) refers to a computing state where all available memory, including swap space,
has been allocated. When this situation occurs, it will cause the system to panic and
stop functioning as expected. There is a switch that controls OOM behavior in /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom.

When set to 1 the kernel will panic on OOM.

A setting of 0 instructs the kernel to call a function named oom_killer on an OOM.
Usually, oom_killer can kill rogue processes and the system will survive.

It is also possible to prioritize which processes get killed by adjusting the oom_killer score.
In /proc/PID/ there are two tools labeled oom_adj and oom_score. Valid scores for oom_adj are in
the range -16 to +15. To see the current oom_killer score, view the oom_score for the process.
oom_killer will kill processes with the highest scores first.
